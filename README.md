# PANOPTES Data Explorer

The PANOPTES Data Explorer can be used to find information about PANOPTES data.

This page gives an overview of how the data is logically organized (the [data model](#data-odel)),
how it is captured by each PANOPTES unit ([data input](#data-input)), and how the
data is then made publically available ([data output](#data-output)).

The [PIAA pipeline](https://github.com/panoptes/PIAA) is responsible for moving the 
data from the units (input) to the public (output) while always respecting the data model.

The data is described in more detail [below](#data-desc).
